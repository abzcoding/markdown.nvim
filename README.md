# Features

- Functions entirely inside of Neovim with no external windows
- Changes between `rendered` view in normal mode and `raw` view in all other modes
- Changes `conceallevel` between `rendered` and `raw` view based on configuration
- Supports rendering `markdown` injected into other file types
- Highlights headings with different groups depending on level and replaces `#`
- Updates horizontal breaks with full-width lines
- Highlights code blocks and inline code to better stand out
- Replaces bullet points with provided character based on level
- Replaces checkboxes with provided characters based on whether they are checked
- Replaces block quote leading `>` with provided character
- Updates table borders with better border characters, does NOT automatically align
- Basic support for `LaTeX` if `latex` parser and `pylatexenc` are installed
- Disable rendering when file is larger than provided value
- Support for [callouts](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925)
- Support custom handlers which are ran identically to builtin handlers

# Limitations

- Text that extends beyond available space will overwrite content [#35](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/markdown.nvim/issues/35)
- `LaTeX` formula evaluations are placed above rather than overlayed [#6](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/markdown.nvim/issues/6)

# Dependencies

- [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) parsers:
  - [markdown & markdown_inline](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown):
    Used to parse `markdown` files
  - [latex](https://github.com/latex-lsp/tree-sitter-latex) (Optional):
    Used to get `LaTeX` blocks from `markdown` files
- System dependencies:
  - [pylatexenc](https://pypi.org/project/pylatexenc/) (Optional):
    Used to transform `LaTeX` strings to appropriate unicode using `latex2text`

# Commands

`:RenderMarkdownToggle` - Switch between enabling & disabling this plugin

- Function can also be accessed directly through `require('render-markdown').toggle()`

# For `vimwiki` Users

If you use [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), because it overrides the
`filetype` of `markdown` files there are additional setup steps.

- Add `vimwiki` to the `file_types` configuration of this plugin

```lua
require('render-markdown').setup({
    file_types = { 'markdown', 'vimwiki' },
})
```

- Register `markdown` as the parser for `vimwiki` files

```lua
vim.treesitter.language.register('markdown', 'vimwiki')
```

# Custom Handlers

Custom handlers allow users to integrate custom rendering for either unsupported
languages or to override / extend the builtin implementations.

This can also be used to disable a builtin handler, by not specifying the `extends`
field and leaving the implementation blank. Though this has little benefit and
can be accomplished in other ways such as setting `{ latex_enabled = false }`
for `LaTeX`.

Still as an example disabling the `LaTeX` handler can be done with:

```lua
require('render-markdown').setup({
    custom_handlers = {
        latex = { render = function() end },
    },
}
```

Each handler must conform to the following interface:

```lua
---@class render.md.Handler
---@field public render fun(namespace: integer, root: TSNode, buf: integer)
---@field public extends? boolean
```

The `render` function parameters are:

- `namespace`: The id that this plugin interacts with when setting and clearing `extmark`s
- `root`: The root treesitter node for the specified language
- `buf`: The buffer containing the root node

The `extends` parameter defines whether the builtin handler should still be run in
conjunction with this one. Defaults to `false`.

Custom handlers are ran identically to builtin ones, so by writing custom `extmark`s
(see :h nvim_buf_set_extmark()) to the provided `namespace` this plugin will handle
clearing the `extmark`s on mode changes as well as re-calling the `render` function
when needed.

This is a high level interface, as such creating, parsing, and iterating through
a treesitter query is entirely up to the user if the functionality they want needs
this. We do not provide any convenience functions, but you are more than welcome
to use patterns from the builtin handlers.

## More Complex Example

Lets say for `python` we want to highlight lines with function definitions.

```lua
-- Parse query outside of the render function to avoid doing it for each call
local query = vim.treesitter.query.parse('python', '(function_definition) @def')
local function render_python(namespace, root, buf)
    for id, node in query:iter_captures(root, buf) do
        local capture = query.captures[id]
        local start_row, _, _, _ = node:range()
        if capture == 'def' then
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(buf, namespace, start_row, 0, {
                end_row = start_row + 1,
                end_col = 0,
                hl_group = 'DiffDelete',
                hl_eol = true,
            })
        end
    end
end
require('render-markdown').setup({
    custom_handlers = {
        python = { render = render_python },
    },
}
```

# Purpose

There are many existing markdown rendering plugins in the Neovim ecosystem. However,
most of these rely on syncing a separate browser window with the buffer. This is
the correct way to do things to get full feature support, however I wanted something
that worked completely inside of Neovim and made things look slightly "nicer".

The closest one I found to this was [headlines.nvim](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/headlines.nvim),
which is an awesome plugin that I took several ideas from. However it just didn't
have quite what I was looking for. In particular I wanted something that would
disappear completely when editing a file and quickly render some style when viewing
the file. Hence this plugin.

# Markdown Ecosystem

There are many `markdown` plugins that specialize in different aspects of interacting
with `markdown` files. This plugin specializes in rendering the buffer inside of
Neovim, for instance. As a result some plugins will clash with this one, whereas
other plugins handle orthogonal concerns and can be used in addition to this one.
Below is a categorized (incomplete) list of available plugins.

## Render in Neovim

Using any of these plugins with this one will likely lead to undesired behavior as
different functionality will clash.

- [headlines.nvim](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/headlines.nvim) - Same high
  level idea and starting point of this plugin, but with different feature sets

## Render in Browser

These can be used as a second pass to get a real preview of the `markdown` file.
Since they do not interact with the buffer directly there should be no issues.

- [markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)
- [vim-markdown-composer](https://github.com/euclio/vim-markdown-composer)

## Orthogonal

These plugins handle functions completely separate from rendering and should also
have no issues running alongside this plugin.

- Any LSP which provides standard LSP capabilities, such as:
  - [marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman) - General completion,
    definition, and reference functionality
  - [markdown-oxide](https://github.com/Feel-ix-343/markdown-oxide) - Adds Obsidian
    PKM features to LSP
- [markdown.nvim](https://github.com/tadmccorkle/markdown.nvim) - Adds `markdown`
  specific keybindings for interacting with `markdown` files
